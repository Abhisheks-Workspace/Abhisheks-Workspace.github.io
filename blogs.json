Data scientists use statistical analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data engineering, data visualization, and other techniques to solve complex problems, make data-driven decisions, and create predictive models. They work with various types of data, such as structured, unstructured, big, small, text, image, audio, video, etc., and across various domains, such as business, healthcare, education, entertainment, social media,\u00a0etc.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity is a field that focuses on protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches. Cybersecurity experts are responsible for spotting vulnerabilities, putting preventive measures in place, detecting and handling security incidents, and developing risk-mitigation plans. They cover topics such as network security, data security, application security, cloud security, cryptography, ethical hacking, penetration testing, incident response, etc.</p>\n<p>Both data science and cybersecurity are in high demand as businesses need help to preserve their sensitive data and capitalize on big data\u2019s potential.

But how did I compare them and decide which one was right for me? Here are some of the factors that I considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>My passion</strong>: I asked myself what topics I was more passionate about and enjoyed learning more. Did I prefer working with numbers and statistics or with codes and systems? Did I prefer finding patterns and insights or finding flaws and solutions? Did I prefer creating models or securing networks?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>My skills</strong>: I assessed my current skills and identified my strengths and weaknesses. Did I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics or in computer science and programming? Did I have experience with data analysis tools or with security tools? Did I have good communication skills or good analytical skills?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>My goals</strong>: I envisioned my future goals and where I wanted to be in five or ten years. Did I want to work in a specific industry or domain that required more data science or more cybersecurity skills? Did I want to work in a specific role or position that involved more data science or more cybersecurity tasks? Did I want to pursue further education or certification in either\u00a0field?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>My opportunities</strong>: I researched the current market trends and demands for both fields. Which field had more job openings or higher salaries in my location or desired location? Which field had more growth potential or innovation potential in the near future? Which field had more networking or learning opportunities in my community or\u00a0online?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How I Made My Final\u00a0Decision</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NR_3hbc_MKnEuPO9\"></figure><p>After careful consideration and reflection, I have confidently chosen cybersecurity as my career path.
